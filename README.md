The hosts file contains 68,456+ links: 
```
Unified hosts(adware + malware) + gambling + porn links from https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
```
and + **Illegal, suggestive Korean websites**.

# What is it?

You can block websites you don't want to use or accidentally access.

Add the Hosts file to your PC, containing the websites link, and it will basically block your access to them. It will not depend on whatever OS you have.
<br><br>

# Where to put the hosts file?

```
Windows: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

mac OS (until 10.14.x macOS Mojave), iOS, Android, Linux: /etc/hosts

macOS Catalina: /private/etc/hosts
```

You must remove the filetype from the file name.

**hosts.txt -> hosts**
